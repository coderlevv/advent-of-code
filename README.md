# Advent of Code solutions 

I came across [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2021 and was instantly hooked. I started this repository along the 2022 event. Solutions of puzzles from earlier events are not available here (yet).

## 2022
For this event one of my intentions was to hone my JavaScript skills. For the first half this worked just fine, in the second half, when the puzzles became more complicated, I switched back to my "go-to" programming language, Python. Together with a jupyter notebook this is the perfect environment for me to creatively & quickly explore ideas and build solutions step by step.
