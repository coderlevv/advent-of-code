# Advent of Code solutions 

I came across [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2021 and was instantly hooked.
I started this repository along the 2022 event. Solutions of puzzles from earlier events are not available here (yet).

For this event the intention was to hone my JavaScript skills. In the end, I used JavaScript for about half
of the puzzles and switched to my go-to programming language, Python, for the other half. Python together
with a Jupyter notebook is the perfect environment for me to creatively & quickly explore ideas and build
solutions step by step.

I was picking up some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) over the last two years, so this years AoC was a great opportunity to apply my newly aquired knowledge of the language. It was another great AoC experience and I'd say I have a good deal of Rust experience under the belt now. Looking forward to the next systems programming project...  

## 2024
This year's Advent of Code was again an exciting journey into solving challenges while honing my TypeScript skills. My goal was to use this event as an opportunity to get more comfortable with TypeScript, and Iâ€™m happy to say it worked out very well!

Despite the challenges (mostly day 21 and some part 2 challenges), the experience was incredibly rewarding. Advent of Code has become a cherished tradition in my yearâ€”a time to dive into code, learn, and grow as a problem solver with programming skills. It's now firmly embedded in my schedule, much like the holiday classic, "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"! ðŸ˜Š
