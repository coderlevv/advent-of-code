# Advent of Code solutions 

I came across [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2021 and was instantly hooked.
I started this repository along the 2022 event. Solutions of puzzles from earlier events are not available here (yet).

## 2022
For this event the intention was to hone my JavaScript skills. In the end, I used JavaScript for about half
of the puzzles and switched to my go-to programming language, Python, for the other half. Python together
with a Jupyter notebook is the perfect environment for me to creatively & quickly explore ideas and build
solutions step by step.

## 2023
I was picking up some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) over the last two years, so this years AoC was a great opportunity to apply my newly aquired knowledge of the language. It was another great AoC experience and I'd say I have a good deal of Rust experience under the belt now. Looking forward to the next systems programming project...  

## 2024
This year, my focus was on getting familiar with TypeScript, and the event provided an excellent platform to dive deeper into the language. While most days went smoothly, there were some real brainteasers (mostly day 21 and some part 2 challenges)! Advent of Code has become a cherished tradition in my year, offering a blend of fun, learning, and problem-solving. I’m already looking forward to next year’s challenges!

### Programming Environment for Advent of Code 2024

For the 2024 Advent of Code, I embraced a minimalist and distraction-free environment to fully focus on solving the puzzles. This approach ensured that my attention was entirely on the problem at hand. Here's an overview of my setup:

- **Operating System:** A [Linux From Scratch (LFS) system](https://github.com/coderlevv/lfshelper), version 12.2, built completely from sources.
- **Custom Build Tool:** I used **lfshelper**, a program I developed to (semi-)automate the LFS build process. It's available [on GitHub](https://github.com/coderlevv/lfshelper).
- **Console-Only Workflow:** Staying true to minimalism, I worked entirely within the console:
  - **Vim** served as my IDE, fully embodying the philosophy described in *Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought*. With the **ALE**, **eslint**, and **prettier** plugins, I had real-time linting, error checking, and formatting seamlessly integrated—combining the efficiency of a console-based workflow with modern development tools.
  - **screen** allowed me to efficiently manage and switch between multiple terminal sessions, keeping my workspace organized and productive.
- **Programming Language:** All puzzles were implemented in **TypeScript**, making it an ideal opportunity to deepen my understanding of the language.

This minimalist setup, free of unnecessary distractions, provided the perfect environment to focus entirely on problem-solving. Tools like Vim and its powerful plugins ensured a smooth and efficient coding experience, while the console-based workflow kept things simple and productive.
