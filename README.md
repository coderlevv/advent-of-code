# Advent of Code solutions 

I came across [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2021 and was instantly hooked.
I started this repository along the 2022 event. Solutions of puzzles from earlier events are not available here (yet).

## 2022
For this event the intention was to hone my JavaScript skills. In the end, I used JavaScript for about half
of the puzzles and switched to my go-to programming language, Python, for the other half. Python together
with a Jupyter notebook is the perfect environment for me to creatively & quickly explore ideas and build
solutions step by step.

## 2023
I was picking up some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) over the last two years, so this years AoC was a great opportunity to apply my newly aquired knowledge of the language. It was another great AoC experience and I'd say I have a good deal of Rust experience under the belt now. Looking forward to the next systems programming project...
