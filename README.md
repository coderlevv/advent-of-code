# Advent of Code solutions 

I came across [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in 2021 and was instantly hooked. I started this repository along the 2022 event. Solutions of puzzles from earlier events are not available here (yet).

## 2022
For this event the intention was to hone my JavaScript skills. In the end, I used JavaScript for about half of the puzzles and switched to my "go-to" programming language, Python, for the other half. Together with a jupyter notebook this is the perfect environment for me to creatively & quickly explore ideas and build solutions step by step.
